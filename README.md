# 🎅 Advent of Code 2024 🎁

## Note
I am using AOC24 to refresh on C#. It's been several years so please if you see any code that is sloppy or overly complex, know I'm rusty.

## Organization
Each solution is in a numeric folder named by `Day##`. The cs file will have two methods for part1 and part2.
At the root, there is an inputs folder where each `Day##_part[1|2].txt`

Each folder, complete or not, will contain the above items easing the startup time once the next puzzle is available. 

## Execution
dotnet run -c release

## Tests
TBD
