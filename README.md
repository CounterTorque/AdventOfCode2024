# 🎅 Advent of Code 2024 🎁

## Note
I am using AOC24 to refresh on C#. It's been several years so please if you see any code that is sloppy or overly complex, know I'm rusty.
If I don't solve a Day on it's associated date, I move on. I also won't spend more than about 90 minutes on any given day. 

## Organization
Each solution is in a numeric folder named by `Day##`. The cs file will have two methods for part1 and part2.
At the root, there is an inputs folder where each `Day##.txt`

Each folder, complete or not, will contain the above items easing the startup time once the next puzzle is available. 

Change the Day pointed and Parts to solve in they Program.cs file.
## Execution
dotnet run -c release

## Tests
TBD

## Solutions
